On the platform Thursday evening, where #RIPTwitter was the top trend worldwide, users wrote what they feared might be their last posts, offering apprehensive goodbyes and listing the other (more stable) social media platforms where they can still be found.         They were reacting to the dire news emanating from inside Twitter. Scores of remaining employees at the social media company on Thursday appeared to reject owner Elon Musk\\u2019s ultimatum to work \\u201cextremely hardcore,\\u201d throwing the communications platform into utter disarray and raising serious questions about how much longer it will survive.  A version of this article first appeared in the \\u201cReliable Sources\\u201d newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.      The death of Twitter would have weighty consequences, given how integral the platform is to global communications. The platform has often been compared to a digital town square. World leaders use Twitter to communicate, journalists use Twitter to newsgather, dissidents in repressive countries use Twitter to organize, celebrities and major brands use Twitter to make important announcements, and the public often uses Twitter to monitor all of it in real-time.        If the platform were to die off, or become unusable because of instability issues, no single space would immediately replace it and communications could become fractured across multiple social media websites, leading to a seismic disruption and slowdown in the flow of information.        Inside the company\\u2019s Slack, a mass resignation effectively occurred after Musk\\u2019s 5pm deadline for employees to arrive at a decision passed. Hundreds of staffers appear to have called it quits, accepting Musk\\u2019s offer to exit in exchange for three months of severance.  SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019.  Mike Blake/ReutersTwitter employees head for the exits after Elon Musk's 'extremely hardcore' work ultimatum      Employees flooded the \\u201c#social-watercooler\\u201d channel with the salute emoji, indicating that they had chosen not to sign Musk\\u2019s pledge. A similar series of events unfolded in the Slack channel earlier this month as Musk eliminated roughly 50% of the company\\u2019s then 7,500-person workforce.        A former Twitter executive, who recently exited the company, described the situation as a \\u201cmass exodus.\\u201d Asked about the situation, the former executive said, \\u201cElon is finding out that he can\\u2019t bully top senior talent. They have lots of options and won\\u2019t put up with his antics.\\u201d        \\u201cThey will struggle just to keep the lights on,\\u201d the former executive added.        That assessment was universally shared by the other half dozen current and former employees on Thursday. It was already bad enough after Musk executed mass layoffs at the company earlier this month. So bad that Twitter asked some of the people it had let go to come back just days later. The state-of-play has only become more dire since then.        In fact, Twitter management was in panic mode hours before the deadline passed, people familiar with the matter said, explaining that senior leaders were \\u201cscrambling\\u201d to convince talent to stay at the company.

might be their last posts, offering apprehensive goodbyes and listing the other (more stable) social media platforms where they can still be found.         they were reacting to the dire news emanating from inside twitter. scores of remaining employees at the social media company on thursday appeared to reject owner elon musk\\u2019s ultimatum to work \\u201cextremely hardcore,\\u201d

sources\\u201d newsletter. sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.      the death of twitter would have weighty consequences, given how integral the platform is to global communications. the platform has often been compared to a digital town square. world leaders use twitter to communicate, journalists use twitter to newsgather, dissidents in repressive countries use twitter to organize, celebrities and major brands use twitter to make important announcements, and the public often uses twitter to monitor all of it in real-time.        if the platform were to die off, or become unusable because of instability issues, no single space would immediately replace it and communications could become fractured across multiple social media websites, leading to a seismic disruption and slowdown in the flow of information.        inside the company\\u2019s slack, a mass resignation effectively occurred after musk\\u2019s 5pm deadline for employees to arrive at a decision passed. hundreds of staffers appear to have called it quits, accepting musk\\u2019s offer to exit in exchange for three months of severance.  spacex owner and tesla ceo elon musk

to sign musk\\u2019s pledge. a similar series of events unfolded in the slack channel earlier this month as musk eliminated roughly 50% of the company\\u2019s then 7,500-person workforce.        a
